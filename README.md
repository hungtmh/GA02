# GA01 – Group Website

Live site: https://ga-01.vercel.app

This is a simple, responsive website introducing the GA01 group and its members. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

## Quick start

Open locally (no server required):
- Download or clone the repository
- Open `index.html` in your browser

## Features
- Home page and About page
- 5 member detail pages
- Responsive layout (header, navigation, footer, sidebar)
- Theme via CSS variables (dark: slate + emerald)

## Theming
Colors are centralized in `css/style.css` under the `:root` variables. Change these to switch themes (background, text, primary button/link, borders, etc.).

## Hosting
- Hosted on Vercel: https://ga-01.vercel.app
- Any static host works (GitHub Pages/Netlify/etc.) since this is a pure static site.
